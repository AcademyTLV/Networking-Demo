# fundamentals-session5-Networking-Demo


This is a demo app to perform network calls in Android, 
as taught on Session 5 on Android Academy's Fundamentals course on session 5.
Slides can be found here: https://goo.gl/BNTjhV




To run this project and perform the network calls, you first need to get from Foursquare (the api we used) a Client Id and a Client Secret. 
Obtain your keys here: https://developer.foursquare.com/
Then copy and paste them in StaticParams.java 






Note: During class we were focused on the commands that perform the actions we wanted.
In this project, check out how are the classes and repositories organized, 
to help you achieve a cleaner code. We'll discuss that later during the course, 
and I'll add here some further explanation in a few days. 



In the meantime: ask us anything on Slack or https://www.facebook.com/groups/android.academy.ils/




See you next time! üòç
